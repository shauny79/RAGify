# RAGify

**RAGify** is a beginner-friendly Python tool that extracts text from a PDF, cleans and formats it, then builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI and LangChain. Use it to:

- Generate a clean `.txt` version of any PDF (ideal for NotebookLM or Custom GPTs)  
- Split text into chunks, embed them with OpenAIâ€™s embeddings, and store in FAISS  
- Ask questions of your document straight from the command line
