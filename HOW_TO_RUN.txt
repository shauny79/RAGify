🧠 HOW TO RUN RAGify (PDF AI Assistant)

RAGify lets you:
✅ Upload a PDF
✅ Extract and download clean text
✅ Ask GPT-3.5 questions about the PDF content only (not the internet)

---

✅ STEP 1: Open Terminal and go to the RAGify folder

cd ~/Documents/"GitHub Projects"/RAGify

---

✅ STEP 2: Enter your OpenAI API key manually (every time you run it)

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

(Replace with your actual OpenAI key. It is temporary and disappears after you close Terminal.)

---

✅ STEP 3: Start the RAGify app

python3 -m streamlit run app.py

---

✅ STEP 4: Use the app in your browser

- Upload a PDF
- Wait for it to process
- 📥 Click "Download Clean Text File" to save the output
- ❓ Ask GPT-powered questions about the PDF content
- Done!

The app will open at: http://localhost:8501

---

📁 FILES:

- `clean_text.txt` → the clean output text from your PDF
  - Use this with:
    - 📘 NotebookLM (as a source)
    - 🤖 CustomGPTs (upload in the GPT builder)
    - 🧩 AI Agents or RAG systems

---

📌 NOTES:

- You must install the dependencies **once** (if you're on a new Mac):
  pip3 install streamlit langchain langchain-community openai faiss-cpu pypdf

- If `pip3` doesn’t work, try:
  python3 -m pip install [package]

---

🚀 Optional: Use the `start.sh` file to automate launching

1. Open Terminal
2. Run: ./start.sh
3. Then manually enter your OpenAI key as shown above
